The VoIP Packet Analysis Tool is a software application that allows users to extract relevant information from VoIP packets between two end devices and decode the relevant data. The packets can be used to extract useful information like the IP addresses of the clients, the VoIP server, their location, their ISP details, time and date of communication, and duration of communication.

### Features

The software dynamically analyzes the packets using modules like pyshark after we upload the packet to it. An interface will be provided where users can upload a VoIP packet with the case number. This capture would be analyzed by using the python modules (pyshark) for deeper analysis. The analyzed data would be presented in a report format either graphically or analytically readable. Also, the analyzed data can be downloaded in a pdf format that embeds picharts.
